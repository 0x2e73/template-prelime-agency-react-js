# WEB AGENCY TEMPLATE

This project is a React JS adaptation of a [Preline](https://preline.co/templates/agency/index.html) template originally developed in HTML/Tailwind CSS. I've preserved all the visual advantages of the template while adding the power of React and custom animations for an enhanced user experience.

## 📋 Features

- **Preline UI Base**: Utilizing Preline's elegant UI components
- **React JS**: Modular structure with reusable components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Fast and responsive styling
- **Animations**: Custom visual effects for a better user experience
- **Responsive Design**: Adapted to all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
